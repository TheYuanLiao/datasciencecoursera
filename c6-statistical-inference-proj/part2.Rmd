```

## Overview

This is an R Markdown document for Statistical Inference Course Project - part 2. Here, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

```{r lib, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libs
library(ggplot2)
```

## Load data for exploratory data analysis
Load data and take a look.
```{r data, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libs
data('ToothGrowth')
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

Show the unique values of dose which looks like a categorical variable.
```{r data.exp, echo=TRUE}
print(unique(ToothGrowth$dose))

```

```{r data.exp.vs, echo=TRUE}
# Take a look at the data
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=factor(dose, levels = c(0.5, 1.0, 2.0)), 
                        y=len, 
                        group=factor(dose, levels = c(0.5, 1.0, 2.0)))) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill=len)) +
  facet_grid(supp ~ dose, labeller=label_both) +
  labs(x='Dose', y='Length') +
  theme_bw()
```

## Compare tooth growth by supp and dose

Two-sample t test is applied to compare the impact of supp and dose on len with confidence interval = 95%.

### Hypothesis 1: two supplement groups have different distributions of tooth length

```{r supp, echo=TRUE}
t.test(len~supp,data=ToothGrowth)

```
It turns out that p-value is 0.06 which is greater than 0.05. Therefore, the hypothesis is rejected.

### Hypothesis 2: dose = 0.5 and does = 1 have different distributions of tooth length

```{r does.1, echo=TRUE}
t.test(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose %in% c(0.5, 1),])

```
It turns out that p-value < 0.001. Therefore, the hypothesis is accepted.

### Hypothesis 3: dose = 1 and does = 2 have different distributions of tooth length

```{r does.2, echo=TRUE}
t.test(len~dose,data=ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose %in% c(1, 2),])

```
It turns out that p-value < 0.001. Therefore, the hypothesis is accepted.

## Conclusions
With the below assumptions:

1. The analyzed data respresent the true population.

2. Multi-level comparison is approximated by a series of two-sample t tests.

3. Ignore the interaction between supplement and dose on tooth length.

4. Sample/population data follow normal distribution.

There is no effect of supplement on tooth length. The higer the dose, the greater the tooth length.
